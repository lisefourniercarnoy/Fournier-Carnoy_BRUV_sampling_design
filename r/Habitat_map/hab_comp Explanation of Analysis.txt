So. The point of this analysis is to compare the habitat maps made from preferential and spatially balanced BRUV sampling designs. We use General Additive Models (GAMs) to predict the extent of Macroalgae, Invertebrate, Sand, Rock and Seagrass habitats in Geographe Bay.

(add more literature etc. on it once it's done)
